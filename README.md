# Cleaning US Census Data:

**This project is part of the nanodegree course "Data Science" offered by Codecademy (www.codecademy.com)**

You just got hired as a Data Analyst at the Census Bureau, which collects census data and creates interesting visualizations and insights from it.

The person who had your job before you left you all the data they had for the most recent census. It is in multiple csv files. They didnâ€™t use pandas, they would just look through these csv files manually whenever they wanted to find something. Sometimes they would copy and paste certain numbers into Excel to make charts.

The thought of it makes you shiver. This is not scalable or repeatable.

Your boss wants you to make some scatterplots and histograms by the end of the day. Can you get this data into pandas and into reasonable shape so that you can make these histograms?
